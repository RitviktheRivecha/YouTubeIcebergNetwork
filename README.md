# YouTubeIcebergNetwork
Networks project visualizing the relationships between communities of iceberg YouTubers

The ‘iceberg chart’ is an image format used to convey information about a certain subject in an easily
digestible way. At the top of the image, or ‘the tip of the iceberg’, well known information about that
subject is listed, and as you progress down the image, more obscure information about the subject is
listed. Starting in 2020, YouTubers have been making ‘iceberg explained’ videos, simply explaining
all the information found on an iceberg chart. In the five years since, iceberg videos have become a
prominent genre on YouTube, with thousands of videos covering a range of different subjects.

However, unlike other YouTube genres such as commentary, gaming, or beauty, there is no commonly
recognized ‘community’ among iceberg YouTubers, since while the video formats are the same, the
video subjects differ vastly. However, anecdotal observations have shown that some people enjoy
watching iceberg videos in general, no matter the subject. So, as someone who both creates and views
iceberg videos, it is in my interest to ask- is there a community of people who enjoy iceberg videos in
general? Or in other words, is there a significant network of people who watch a variety of iceberg
YouTubers? Are there further sub-communities within a greater iceberg video community based
around creator or genre? Are there specific videos or YouTubers which act as ’hubs’ the rest of the
community are centered around? Through answering these questions, valuable analytic information
will be uncovered which can help iceberg YouTubers with collaboration and marketing strategies.
